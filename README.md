## Basic Overview
A full stack web app built with ReactJS, Express, and Node and our backbone Sentiment Analysis that displays a feed of positive news articles.<br>
<br>
You can search for specific news where in we will be showing you first all the positive new and then some of the negative ones too ;)
<br>

Bad news is everywhere and easy to find. Yes, problems should be exposed so they can be fixed but what about all of the great things going on currently? Our Happy Space is built to encourage people to find positivity in the world and give them something to look forward to after reading the news. It uses <a href="https://github.com/thisandagain/sentiment">sentiment</a> to analyze and filter negative news articles from News data provided by the <a href="https://newsapi.org/">News API</a>.
